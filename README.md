# Incorporating Vision Encoders into Retrieval Augmented Visual Question Answering

Welcome to the project repository for "Incorporating Vision Encoders into Retrieval Augmented Visual Question Answering". This project is under the supervision of Prof. Bill Byrne and co-supervised by Weizhe Lin, at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge.

## Overview

This project (ongoing) aims to explore and enhance the capabilities of visual question answering through the incorporation of advanced vision encoders in the context of retrieval-augmented frameworks. Our focus lies in pushing the boundaries of how visual information can be effectively integrated with textual question answering systems.

## Original RAVQA Project

The original RAVQA (Retrieval-Augmented Visual Question Answering) project serves as a foundation and inspiration for our work. You can find more details about the original RAVQA project here: [RAVQA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Retrieval-Augmented-Visual-Question-Answering)
